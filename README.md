This Project Aims to optimize the testing process in Manufacturing of Benz cars.

In Specific it involves to reduce the time spent by cars on the test bench.

Given Dataset involves 378 features with 4209 instances for both test & train data

Data with low variance are removed and Dimensionality Redcution is performed for better results.

Ensemble Algorithms like XGBoost are used.
